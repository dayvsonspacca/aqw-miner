    "description": "If the Ruler is the head of the Kingdom of Astravia, then the Generals are their bloodied hands. More often not, their white armor was dyed red by their great deeds. Regulus and Titania wished for the peaceful age their Prince would usher in. One where their armor would shine instead of bleed.",
