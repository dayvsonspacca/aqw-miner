    "description": "The mountains where Nulgath has created his fortress are filled with various Dragons, Wyrms, and assorted other creatures. Unlike the DragonSlayers, these Dragon Tamers do not kill these creatures, but tame them to their will. Probably so they can set them upon all of Nulgath's enemies.",
