    "description": "When it matters most, do not settle for less by getting something of inferior make. This is a genuine FireWalker Mask, not some knock-off that will invite ruin to your head. The red band washes the world in a red glow, revealing the true nature of those around you, and if you are lucky, reveal a hidden fire elemental.",
