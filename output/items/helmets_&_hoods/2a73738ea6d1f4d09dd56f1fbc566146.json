    "description": "While others /partied, you studied the blade. While others were training their reputation, you mastered the art of unsheathing and striking. While others wasted their days being AFK in Yulgar, you cultivated inner strength. Now that the world is set aflame and the fiends are at the gates, only you have the power to cut through shadow as if it were steel.",
