    "description": "After years of testing and countless dead testing subjects, Ebilcorp has decided to release the Nanobite Cape to all of its assassins. While the cape acts like a shield; side effects may include but not are limited to: death, nausea, memory loss, hearing loss, hunger, starvation and loss in vision. Kind of makes sense why this wasn't approved for release!",
