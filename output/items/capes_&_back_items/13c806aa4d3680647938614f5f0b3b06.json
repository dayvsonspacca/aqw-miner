    "description": "The Hollowborn Judge's sentence is final. Once in \"sub judice\", fundamental principles about justice, equality, equity and, above all, morality, will be weighed. Shadow Fiend is not unfair and has made the Hollowborn Judge unable to act unfairly. Therefore, no matter the outcome of the judgment, it will always be fair. The scale will always be in balance.",
