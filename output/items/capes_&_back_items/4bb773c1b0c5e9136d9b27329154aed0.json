    "description": "The principles of Justice taught by the Hollowborn Judge influence the living, the reborn and the dead. No matter what stage of life they are in, the conviction for justice makes them faithful followers of the Hollowborn Judge. Control? Order? Penance? None of that matters. The feeling of devotion they feel for the liberating ideals of justice made them build an altar through which the Hollowborn Judge can exercise their jurisdiction.",
