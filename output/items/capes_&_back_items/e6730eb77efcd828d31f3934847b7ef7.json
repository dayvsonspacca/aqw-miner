    "description": "Aurola's parents reminisced about the baby they had been too poor to care for. They wrapped their weeping child in a red blanket, and left her on the doorstep of an orphanage. Years later, her parents watched a Knight draped in red and white walking the royalty home. It was a relief, seeing that Aurola had found a family she deserved.",
