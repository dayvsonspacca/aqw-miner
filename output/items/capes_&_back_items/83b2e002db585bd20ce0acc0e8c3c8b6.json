    "description": "After years of testing, and countless dead test subjects, EbilCorp has decided to release the Nanobite Cape and Katanas to all of its assassins. While the cape acts like a shield; side effects may include but are not limited to: death, nausea, memory loss, hearing, loss, hunger, starvation, and loss in vision. Kind of makes sense why this wasn't approved for release!",
